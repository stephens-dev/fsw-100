                The Origin Story of Coffee in America
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Captain John Smith, the founder of the Colony of Virginia, introduced coffee in America when he shared it with the other Jamestown settlers in 1607 after learning about it in his travels to Turkey. Surprisingly, coffee’s popularity did not take off right away. These newly arrived Americans were still too accustomed to drinking tea, hard cider and ale.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                After that period, the next early reference to coffee was in 1668 when a beverage in New York was made from roasted coffee beans and flavored with honey and cinnamon. By the mid-1700s, taverns often doubled as coffee houses, but coffee was considered “only a drink for the well-to-do” and tea was still the American drink of choice. Nonetheless, during the 17th and 18th centuries, coffee houses were popping up all around Boston, and that trend soon spread to other colonies.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Then, on December 16, 1773, the Sons of Liberty, a group of merchants and tradesmen founded to protest British taxation, disguised themselves as Native Americans, boarded docked ships and threw 342 chests of tea (an amount worth about a million dollars in today’s dollars) into the Boston Harbor in direct opposition to the tea tax.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Famously known as The Boston Tea Party, the eccentric revolt sealed coffee’s fate in America. Drinking tea became an unpatriotic act. Britain was now a country of tea-drinkers and America, coffee-drinkers.
